Revision history for Posy-Plugin-ShortBody
==========================================

0.50 Sun 16 January 2005
------------------------

  * (16 Jan 2005) fixing header-removal stuff
  	Changed short_body_remove_header to short_body_after_first_header;
  it now removes everything up to the first header if that is true.  Did
  this because the POD files don't actually get to the first header until
  after this long table-of-contents/index thing, which is generated by
  'parse_entry' rather than the Toc plugin, so it's already there when
  ShortBody does its thing.
