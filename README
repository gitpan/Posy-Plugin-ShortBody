==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::ShortBody - Posy plugin to give the start of an entry body


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::ShortBody.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

Purpose: Populates the flavour template variable $entry_short_body with the
first sentence of the entry body (defined as everything before the first .,
!, or ?) and strips out HTML tags along the way. Perfect for providing
shortened, plaintext versions of stories for an RSS feed or summary index.

This creates a 'short_body' entry action, which should be placed after
'parse_entry' in the entry_action list, and before 'render_entry'.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``short_body_remove_header''
If true, removes the first header it encounters in the body, and uses the
first sentence after that. (1 is true, 0 is false) (default: true)

``short_body_replace_body''
If the short_body_replace_body option is true, then this *replaces*
$entry_body with the short body contents. This is useful when one wishes to
speed processing when one knows that only the short body is going to be used
(such as in chrono/category index pages). This needs to be done with care,
naturally. (default: false)


==== REQUIRES ====
